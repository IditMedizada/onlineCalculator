Logic Calculator Principles and Reasons:

1. Arithmetic Order:
   - The calculator processes expressions based on the arithmetic order of operations.

2. Initial Splitting:
   - The first step involves splitting the arithmetic expression according to addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators.

3. Subexpression Evaluation:
   - For each subexpression obtained from the initial split:
     a. Check for the presence of multiplication (*) or division (/) operators.
     b. If found, calculate the result of the subexpression containing these operations.

4. Final Combination:
   - Combine all the subexpressions back together according to the original order of addition and subtraction.
     a. This ensures that the overall arithmetic order is maintained.

5. Order of Operations:
   - Adherence to the order of operations ensures accurate calculation results:
     c. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
     d. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

6. Example:
   - For the expression "3 + 5 * 2 - 4 / 2":
     a. Initial split results in subexpressions: ["3", "5 * 2", "4 / 2"]
     b. Evaluate each subexpression: ["3", "10", "2"]
     c. Combine results: "3 + 10 -2" = 11
